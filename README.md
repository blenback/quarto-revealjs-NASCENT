# Quarto Reveal. js theme for the NASCENT-Peru research project

A Quarto Reveal.js presentation theme for the [NASCENT-Peru project](https://plus.ethz.ch/research/forschungsprojekte/NASCENT-PERU.html), modified from Grant McDermott's [clean theme](https://github.com/grantmcdermott/quarto-revealjs-clean).

## Use

Depending on your use case, here are some [Quarto CLI](https://quarto.org/)
commands to get started.

If you would like to add the **NASCENT** theme to an existing directory:

```bash
quarto install extension blenback/quarto-revealjs-NASCENT
```

Alternatively, you can use a
[Quarto template](https://quarto.org/docs/extensions/starter-templates.html)
that bundles the **NASCENT** theme plus a .qmd starter document. This is a better
option if you are starting a new project from scratch, since it will automatically
create a new directory with all of the necessary scaffolding in one go. 

```bash
quarto use template blenback/quarto-revealjs-NASCENT
```
